            <p>This was the first concert I had ever been to. It was at St. Andrew's Hall in Detroit, MI. I was actually in town visting some family at the time and randomly found out that they had a show that night. They are very well known for their high energy live shows and it ceratinly didn't disappoint. At one point, the lead singer climbed up the speaker towers and was hanging from the side of the top one! It was a great first concert to attend and was just the first of many amazing expereinces I would have.</p>

            <h2> Streetlight Manifesto </h2>

            <p>Streetlight Manifesto is my absolute favorite band and I was so excited when they made a stop in Portland at the Hawthorne theatre a few years ago. At the time, they were considering ending their run together as a band so it was pretty significant to see them finally. Since then, they have decided for the better and are continuing to tour. They are actually going to be in Portland at the end of the month for the 10th anniversary of their best album. They plan to play that album in full along with a selection of their other best songs.</p>

            <h2> Reel Big Fish &amp; Anti-Flag </h2>

            <p>This concert was earlier this year at the Roseland theatre and it was two of my favorite bands together and it was a blast! Reel Big Fish was headlinging the show and they were celebrating the 20th anniversary of their most succesful album and played the whole thing, including B-sides. Anti-Flag was tagging along as another big act from the same time period as Reel Big Fish. They are also have a very large political aspect to the music and overall act, so the current climate in America is a great time for them to be touring. It was so fun seeing two bands I have respected for so long at the same time.</p>

            <p>This was one that was incredibly surprising. I went to a show for Electric Six (which is another band I love) that I had learned about the day it was happening. It was happening at Dante's in Portland. They were great as the headliners, but one of the opening acts just blew me away. They are a two man band from Colorado that I had never heard of before that show, but I now listen to them all the time. Their recordings are great, but their live show was insane. They brought so much energy to the stage that they completely stole the show for me.</p>

            <h2> Flogging Molly </h2>
            <img src=http://clture.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FM1.jpg height="281" width="500">
            <p>Flogging Molly is an incredible band. They present a mix of traditional Irish music with a large dose of punk rock. I have actually seen them three times, most recently at the Oregon Zoo. They have many songs which make everyone jump around and lose their minds, but also mix in a good portion of slow and heartflet songs to break up the action a bit. They have always been great to see and I look forward to getting to see them again in the future.</p>
